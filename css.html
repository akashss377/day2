    <p style="color: blue;">Kerala is one of the small states of India in terms of area. it consists of only 1.3 per cent of the total area of India. The state is located in the southwest corner of India. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu bound it on north, east and south and on east by the Arabian Sea. Physiographically, the state may be divided into three regions, Highlands, Midlands and Lowlands. In between the high western ghats and the Arabian sea, the width of the State varies from 35 km to 120 km. There are extensive backwaters, lagoons, and coconut trees in the lowland area. The midland area are watered by numerous streams and where the presence of rice-fields, arecanut and coconut trees continues to dominate the landscape. </p>
<h2> Trivandrum</h2>
<p style="color: maroon;">Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have been a “must see” destination for ages</p>
